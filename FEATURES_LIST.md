# Features List

## General

* I want to have a link to a feature for each step in financial planning. For example, the insurance link should direct users to a page where they can learn some basics about insurance and run some calculations to estimate how much life insurance they need (I want to provide different options for estimating life insurance needs, e.g. DIME, whatever other options there are), does a PPO plan or an High Deductible Plan + an HSA make more sense in their situation, etc.

## Transactions

* Categorizing transactions: The default category will be "Uncategorized". When users click the dropdown button to categorize a transaction, then a modal will popup that will display all of their budget category groups and categories in the same way that they are listed in their budget.

## Budget

* Users can add category groups and categories directly on the budget page instead of through a separate popup modal.
